                    <p>
                        The Winchester and County Music Festival celebrates its 90th birthday this year. Its great strength is that it trumpets the simple piece of good news: that singing &ndash; and choral singing &ndash; is alive and well and thriving in Hampshire.
                    </p>
                    <p> On Saturday night, tier upon tier of local choral singers had the opportunity of joining forces and singing in Romsey Abbey, ably accompanied by a local amateur orchestra &ndash; some of whose players produced sounds worthy of a professional orchestra pit.
                    </p>
                    <p> In a stirring performance of Bach&rsquo;s <em>St John Passion</em>, they ably negotiated some challenging music with great skill and bundles of enthusiasm and commitment. Much of the story of the passion is narrated by a solo tenor &ndash; the Evangelist. This was one of the finest renditions of the Evangelist I have heard, as the tenor Simon Wall not only recounted the story with pace and a lightness of touch and a silken voice which seemed to float out over the audience, but had the capacity to draw you into the story as if you were sitting round a camp fire listening to this great tale unravel. His understanding of the text and the drama the conveyed meant that the words of the story came to the fore in an often spine-tingling and engaging way. The internationally renowned bass Michael George also did not disappoint as Christ with every brief interjection he delivered was with the depth, thought and gravitas needed. Both of them were accompanied very sensitively and unobtrusively by a fine continuo section of the orchestra.
                    </p>
                    <p> The key to understanding Bach&rsquo;s music is that he is seeking to convey a story, and through different combinations of voices and instruments, of giving the listener the chance to reflect on the story personally. This was a story well told and with colour and light and shade from both choir and orchestra, the full gamut of emotions which Bach masterfully expresses were well conveyed to a full and enthusiastic Abbey audience.
                    </p>
                    <p> This was far from a faultless performance, but it was made up for by two lots of passions. The first, of course, of Bach&rsquo;s , and the second of the palpable passion of local amateur music groups coming together and proving just how important local amateur music-making is and how it is vital that it continues to have a platform for concerts such as this. Here&rsquo;s to the next 90 years!
