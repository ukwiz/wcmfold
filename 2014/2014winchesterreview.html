<p>This concert was an unusual treat, providing the opportunity to hear two works which are not performed as often as they deserve.  Also, since Stanford was Vaughan Williams&rsquo; composition teacher, there was a special chance for comparison.</p>
<p>Once again, the organisers of the Festival, and especially Derek Beck, achieved the feat of getting separately rehearsed choirs &mdash; from Itchen Valley, Overton, Sarisbury, Twyford and Winchester &mdash; to produce very good performances.  The soloists &mdash; Cecilia Osmond, soprano, and Stephen Gadd, baritone &mdash; added considerable lustre, their graceful yet powerful strength of tone often soaring over the combined forces of full choir and orchestra to wonderful effect. </p>
<p>C. V. Stanford&rsquo;s &lsquo;Songs of the Fleet&rsquo; are settings of poems by Henry Newbolt. In these Stephen Gadd gave clear accounts of youthful expectation, the enthusiasms of service life and leadership, and in the last song, the sadness of the loss of comrades.  These achieved the needed depth of feeling and clear changes of mood.  In these, the choir sang refrains which echoed each verse very movingly, especially in the last song, &lsquo;Farewell&rsquo;.  </p>
 <p>The thrilling fanfare and choir opening of Vaughan Williams&rsquo; Sea Symphony &mdash; &lsquo;Behold, the sea&rsquo; is surely one of the most vivid evocations of the power of the sea in music, and this set the tone of a lyrical and moving performance.  For Whitman, there is spiritual significance in the universality of the seas, to which all nations and people are linked, and ultimately recognise their &lsquo;vast similitude&rsquo;.  After the first movement&rsquo;s stunning opening, Cecilia Osmond&rsquo;s  solo passages declaiming the &lsquo;flags of nations&rsquo; came over with ringing clarity.  In the reflective second movement &lsquo;On the beach at night alone&rsquo;, the semi-chorus (provided by the chamber choir Viva Voces) provided beautifully balanced support to Stephen Gadd&rsquo;s thoughtful solo work; this contrasted vividly with the strong &lsquo;vast similitude&rsquo; entry by the full chorus, carrying Whitman&rsquo;s words powerfully.   In the third movement, the tempo makes great demands on orchestra and choir alike, and both conveyed the sea&rsquo;s restless movement.   In the longer last movement, &lsquo;The Explorers&rsquo;, VW uses all the resources to declaim the journey of the soul, and choir and orchestra achieved wonderful climaxes, with the soloists carrying long lines over full forces with great power.  Inner choir parts were often very impressive.  The Festival orchestra provided effective and often thrilling support throughout, as always.</p> 
<p>Many thanks for a truly exciting and rewarding performance!</p>
