                    <br> Mendelssohn: Hymn of Praise </p>
                <div class="text2">
                    <p>The Winchester and County Music Festival is a wonderful institution. The sheer thrill of assembling choral societies from around the county, and have them marshalled so well together is a reminder of the strength of music and choral singing in this area.</p>
                    <p>In the second of their two concerts, performed in Romsey Abbey, we were treated to two contrasting pieces. The first a requiem by Bob Chilcott . Chilcott is a craftsman with tuneful, flowing melodies and the work was reminiscent of Faure, Rutter, Vaughan Williams and Herbert Howells – all English favourites, and Chilcott can stand alongside them on merit. He is fast becoming an established favourite with choirs and rightly so. His Requiem was beautiful and evocative, but never sentimental and dealt with the difficult issue of expressing death and dying in a poignant, positive, serene and uplifting way. Helen Bailey, the soprano soloist, soared effortlessly above the choir and orchestra who played and sang as if they had been performing together for months, rather than just a couple of rehearsals. Sometimes the choir were a little timid with this less familiar piece and some of the soprano entries suffered as a result and sounded strained and under supported.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, they quickly recovered for the second half, Mendelssohn's Hymn of Praise which was sung with great gusto and enthusiasm. This seemed much more in the choirs’ comfort zone. The tenor soloist, Adrian Green, opened up much more in this piece and held his own well in the louder sections although needed a fuller tone to match the music. With a finale, which could only be described as enthusiastic gallop to a rousing close, the choirs and orchestra could congratulate themselves on a job well done.</p>
