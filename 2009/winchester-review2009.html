                    <p>This was a rare opportunity to experience two composers’ very individual interpretations in the genre of the ‘War Requiem’. Both are by turns moving, reflective, and passionate about the futility of war. Both draw on elements of the traditional requiem and sacred texts, often juxtaposing contrasting ideas to make points about the brutality of conflict and the waste of human sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>The Agnus Dei opening of Ralph Vaughan Williams’ ‘Dona Nobis Pacem’ was sensitively sung by the choir. Anna Dennis’s soaring soprano, with its clear full timbre, carried well over choir and orchestra. The second movement emphasises the destruction of life and livelihood; the choir followed the harsh brass chords with powerful stridency. Then more contrast; the choir’s devout wish that “war … must be utterly lost” was reinforced by the baritone soloist, Alex Ashworth, as a soldier bids a moving final farewell to another.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most effective movement was the last. The baritone’s powerful declamations give way to the more reflective reassurance that “in this place I will give peace”. Especially effective were the brilliance of “Open to me the gates of righteousness” and the “Goodwill toward men” final passage, with an unaccompanied choral cadence sung with great warmth and tenderness.</p>
                    <p>Karl Jenkins’ “The Armed Man” takes a medieval marching tune and reworks it, adding texts and verses based on the experiences of two world wars. These provide opportunities for contrasting and often dramatic effects. </p>
                    <p>The choral opening was firm and clear, and the canonic entries crisp and generally well enunciated. The Muslim call to prayer by Imam Anas Al-Korj confirmed that the search for peace can be universal. James Picton-Turbervill, a Cathedral chorister, introduced the Kyrie with its polyphony and Palestrina references, positively and clearly. The rhythmic quality of the Sanctus came across well, as did the drive of the battle scene, with its terminal cacophony, then silence, dramatically broken by the bugler, Army Musician Lawrence Narhkom, sounding the ‘Last Post’.</p>
                    <p>The orchestra, led by Liz Flowers, displayed the clarity, energy and ensemble vital for these two demanding works. These dramatic and moving performances were a great credit to choirs and conductors alike, and especially to Derek Beck as principal conductor.</p>
