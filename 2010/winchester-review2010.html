                <p class="text">Verdi Requiem</p>
                <div class="text2">
                    <p>The choice of Verdi's Requiem was ideal for the opening concert of this year's Winchester and County Music Festival in Winchester Cathedral.
                        <p>The four choirs, Compton and Shawford Festival Choir, ItchenValley Choral Society, Twyford Singers and Winchester City Festival Choir, with an excellent orchestra led by Elizabeth Flower, were conducted by Derek Beck
                            <p> Although Verdi disclaimed any religious feeling, his music successfully captures both the dramatic intensity of the overall work and the spirituality and devotion of the very varied text. The chorus sang with total security and showed the results of excellent preparation. The double choir Sanctus was buoyant, the massive Dies irae sections dramatic and forceful, and the more subdued Requiem Aeternam and Lacrymosa were sung with rich tone and full expression.
                                <p>The final, fugal Libera Me was both accurate and unflagging in effort, a testament to the chorus's stamina and confidence. The solo quartet was well matched in its ensembles and sang with great musicality and expression.
                                    <p> Each member had their high spot; Claire Seaton (soprano) radiant in the final Requiem aeternam and the duet, Recordare, with Deborah Miles-Johnson (mezzo-soprano), who also sang the Liber Scriptus with glorious tone. Andrew MacKenzie-Wicks (tenor) joined them in a thoughtful trio, Quid Sum Miser, and was ideally suited to the appealing Ingemisco, and Michael Bundy (bass) was warm and authoritative in the long lines of the Confutatis. Both soloists and chorus were supported securely and sensitively by the large orchestra and their performance deserves a special mention.
                                        <p>Derek Beck's conducting was firm, well-paced and persuasive and he, the choirs and their conductors must be congratulated on an uplifting performance.
