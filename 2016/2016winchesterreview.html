                </p>
                <p class="text">Conductor: Derek Beck</p>
                <p class="text">ELGAR: Dream of Gerontius</p>
                <div class="text2">
                    <p>This was the third performance of Elgar&rsquo;s <em>Dream of Gerontius</em> in Winchester Cathedral within the space of a year – if anyone missed this latest one because they had already attended one (or both) of the others, then they missed out on a real treat. The joint choirs that constitute the WCMF sang with enthusiasm and conviction, energetic in the fiendish demands of the &lsquo;Demon&rsquo;s Chorus&rsquo; and blazing with joy in the mighty choir of Angelicals. There was also tenderness and consolation in the choruses surrounding Gerontius on his deathbed and in the final Angel&rsquo;s Farewell. The various chorus masters had thoroughly prepared their choirs to meet the huge demands of Elgar&rsquo;s choral writing and mention must be made of the excellent semi-chorus singers, who provided a beautiful contrast to the main choral body.</p>
                    <p>In the key role of <em>Gerontius</em> was tenor Peter Auty, giving us his all as he journeyed through death and into the afterlife. His &lsquo;Sanctis Fortis&rsquo; was fabulously operatic, but he could also produce a suitably pious and prayerful tone when expressing the uncertainties of his fate. His final &lsquo;Take me away&rsquo;, with its dramatic opening top A, was spine-tingling.</p>
                    <p> Emily Bauer-Jones sang the role of the Angel with beauty of tone and intense feeling and her &lsquo;Farewell&rsquo; was a model of tenderness. Just occasionally she lacked the power to cut through the orchestral textures, but her singing was never less than beautiful. Bass Jimmy Holliday is no stranger to Winchester and his voice had tremendous power and presence, filling the cathedral with his rich tone.</p>
                    <p> Derek Beck was the maestro controlling the massed forces and his deep understanding of the Elgarian idiom was the decisive factor in this performance. The orchestra played their hearts out for him with some truly excellent ensemble work and fine solo passage-work. A memorable performance – thank you Derek and WCMF.</p>
