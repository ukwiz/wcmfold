                <div class="text2">
                    <p>Every year no fewer than seven choirs join forces to sing two concerts in the annual Winchester and County Music Festival. It is a great credit to the choirs and their conductors that they produce coherent performances in this way.</p>
                    <p>
                        This year the Cathedral concert was J.S. Bach&rsquo;s <em>St. Matthew Passion</em>. One of Bach&rsquo;s greatest works, its scale and architecture are unparalleled and its varieties of style, with dramatic recitatives, chorale settings, arias and powerful choruses all combine smoothly to give life and pace to the Passion narrative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Derek Beck, the orchestra and choirs. achieved this with an astute combination of lighter execution and faster tempi, and some deft and dramatic singing by both choir and soloists. Some of the choir&rsquo;s chorales were very thoughtful and moving. Those movements which combine recitative and chorus were, by turns, vigorous and reflective and provided, together with the action choruses, some of the greatest moments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was much beautiful singing by the soloists, too. Simon Wall, as Evangelist, had the most demanding role; but he is clearly well practised in it. Involved, dramatic, but never overdramatic, his controlled but commanding declamation was a delight; always crisp and clear, he carried the other performers and the audience with him. Jimmy Holliday, as Christus, was strong, warm and appropriately passionate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nick Pepin, counter tenor, gave moving performances of some of the well-known arias which reflect on the significance of the Passion, <em>Grief for sin</em> and <em>Have mercy, Lord, on me</em>. Alex Ashworth (bass) was convincing as Peter and Judas, and also a thoughtful interpreter of the bass arias. Similarly, Katy Butler and Edward Goater gave expressive renderings of the soprano and tenor arias.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The orchestral and continuo accompaniments were generally clearly and sympathetically executed. The instrumental obbligati by the oboe d/amore, the flutes and particularly the solo violins, were especially warm and clear and complemented the soloists very well.</p>
