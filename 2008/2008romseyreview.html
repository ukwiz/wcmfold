                <div class="text2">
                    <p>This piece is neither small nor solemn lasting well over an hour, and composed as a salon piece accompanied by piano and harmonium, this being Rossini&rsquo;s last major work, written in 1863 towards the end of his life. </p>
                    <p>Although he later wrote an orchestration, it was good to hear it as it was originally intended, performed by the Choral Societies of Botley, Overton and Sarisbury &amp; Hamble, conducted by David Burgess, as part of the Winchester and County Music Festival. </p>
                    <p>There was much sensitive singing from the choirs, particularly in the unaccompanied sections, and the words were audible throughout, although some of the faster sections would have benefitted if more of the singers had been watching the conductor. </p>
                    <p>The four soloists Claire Seaton - soprano, Elinor Carter - contralto, Colin Howard - tenor and Jimmy Holliday - bass gave polished performances both as soloists and as an ensemble and were supported throughout by the faultless pianist Rosemary Field, sadly from where I was sitting the harmonium was almost inaudible.</p>
