                    <p><em>Less well-known works in splendid surroundings.</em></p>
                    <p>The combined choirs of Overton Choral Society, Sarisbury Choral Society and the Winchester Festival Choir met in the splendid Romanesque surroundings of Romsey Abbey, together with the Festival Orchestra, under the direction of Graham Kidd to present a concert of two less well-known works from the repertoire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first half comprised Beethoven&rsquo;s <em>Mass in C</em>, written while Beethoven was still a young composer, but which displays nevertheless music of mature insight bearing the hallmarks of the composer&rsquo;s style. The choirs managed some sensitive dynamic control and effective phrase shaping, contrasted with suitably dramatic and enthusiastic singing to convey the many mood changes in the score, which is serene and lyrical at times, only to be followed later by passages of stormy drama as Beethoven seeks to match music with text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choirs were supported by an able group of soloists who blended musically as an ensemble, very evident in the extended solo writing of the <em>Benedictus</em>. The orchestra accompanied sensitively, and all responded well to Graham Kidd&rsquo;s clear directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second half was the <em>Magnificat</em> by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, son of the great Johann Sebastian. This youthful piece was written in the newly emerging &lsquo;Classical&rsquo; style, though with evidence of the Baroque influence inherited through his father.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here we saw sections for full choir interspersed with extended solo movements in which the obvious talents of the soloists were demonstrated. The crystal purity of Alison Hill&rsquo;s soprano voice soared with exquisite phrasing in the <em>Quia respexit</em>, while Nick Madden, tenor, showed vocal agility and dexterity in the melismatic runs and wide ranging leaps of <em>Quia fecit mihi magna</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choirs, who were unoccupied for lengthy periods at times, managed rhythmic buoyancy in the faster movements and expressive singing to convey the chromatic lyricism of the <em>Et misericordia</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The orchestra played its role commendably and Graham Kidd managed the forces under his control with clarity and authority. The performers were rewarded with prolonged applause from an appreciative audience.
                    </p>
