                    <p><em>Powerful introduction sets tone for invigorating performance</em></p>
                    <p>As usual, the organisers and musical director of the Festival, Derek Beck, have worked their magic and blended the work of four choirs into one performance, enhanced by the addition of some substantial soloists - Sarah-Jane Dale, Deborah Miles-Johnson, Matthew Long and Jimmy Holliday. [The choirs were Botley Choral Society, Compton and Shawford Festival Choir, Itchen Valley Choral Society and the Twyford Singers.]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jimmy Holliday&rsquo;s thrillingly powerful introduction to the oratorio - <em>As God the Lord of Israel liveth</em> set the tone for an invigorating performance; and tenor Matthew Long delivered a moving and lyrical <em>If with all your hearts</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choir rose to these challenges and responded with controlled intensity in <em>Wilt thou be the Lord God in Sion?</em> and contrasting drama in <em>Yet doth the Lord see it not!</em> and also in the Baal choruses where the rising anxiety is often hard to capture. However, the choir did it well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Ashton Singers provided a beautifully clear semi-chorus in such numbers as For <em>He shall give his angels</em> and <em>Lift thine eyes</em> with ringing clear lines and warm assurance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Widow of Zarephath section is never easy; but the soloists lifted this and we were made to feel the desperation of the widow. Similarly, Elijah&rsquo;s exile and crisis of faith are hard to convey but the moving bass solo <em>It is enough</em> sounded appropriately desolate, and the semi-chorus <em>Lift thine eyes</em> provided a sense of reassurance and comfort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deborah Miles-Johnson also sang <em>O rest in the Lord</em> with corresponding warmth. The choir carried the demands of the remaining choruses well; they too need to convey reassurance, often with great vigour. Probably the best example of this is <em>Behold God the Lord passed by</em>, which demands a certain sharpness in the imitative work of its first section, and then clarity of a different kind in <em>Onward came the Lord</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this was a vigorous and satisfying performance, and one that gave great credit to all concerned.
