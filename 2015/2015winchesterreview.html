                <p class="text">Brahms Requiem
                    <br> Parry&rsquo;s Blest Pair of Sirens
                </p>
                <div class="text2">
                    <p>Once again the festival has brought together choirs from Botley, Compton and Shawford, Sarisbury and Winchester to perform together works they have rehearsed separately over several months. The concert, which was masterfully conducted by John Sutton, began with Hubert Parry&rsquo;s splendid <em>Blest Pair of Sirens</em>. This challenging work demands a sense of majestic scale to which the choir responded well. Parry&rsquo;s word-painting was well caught in quieter moments, while the choir rose to the sustained demands of a climactic ending.</p>
                    <p>Brahms&rsquo;s <em>German Requiem</em> is based on Biblical texts, but has perhaps more to do with the consolation of the bereaved and the dying, than the offering of a Mass for the departed Soul. The overall atmosphere Brahms calls for is one of warmth and reassurance. This was achieved in a gentle and restrained opening by the choir and orchestra.</p>
                    <p>The next movement, <em>&lsquo;Behold, all flesh is as the grass&rsquo;</em> emphasises the transience and brevity of life. Its insistent rhythms were firmly delivered, as was the change of mood in <em>&lsquo;the ransomed of the Lord&rsquo;</em>.</p>
                    <p>The baritone soloist Andrew de Silva conveyed well the opening sense of fear, and then of acceptance, in <em>&lsquo;Lord let me know mine end&rsquo;</em>. <em>&lsquo;How lovely are Thy dwellings&rsquo;</em> proved to be one of the best movements. It calls for a clear and firm but mellifluous tone combined with gentle but distinct phrasing which is hard to achieve, but which the choir rose to very convincingly.</p>
                    <p>The sustained phrases of <em>&lsquo;Ye now have sorrow&rsquo;</em> were beautifully sung by the soprano soloist Helen Bailey, with great warmth and clarity. The choir rose to this and produced some of the clearest and best phrased passages of the evening.</p>
                    <p>The final movement of this work echoes the opening, with its restrained affirmation of a state of grace for the departed. The choir and orchestra produced effective quiet contrasts here, leading to the crescendo which faded to the final chord of gentle acceptance.</p>
                    <p>Once again, the Winchester Festival Orchestra and choirs, their conductors and accompanists rose to the considerable demands of melding several choirs together; and they all deserve credit for the effort this requires.</p>
